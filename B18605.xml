            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Case of Robert Walley. Concerning a Conduit-Head in or neer <hi>Spittle-Fields,</hi> Humbly presented to the Consideration of the Right Honourable the Lords Spiritual and temperal, in Parliament assembled.</head>
            <head type="sub">By way of Appeal from a Decree made in <hi>Chancery,</hi> in a Cause wherein <hi>William Cutler</hi> Senior was Plaintiff against the said <hi>Robert Walley</hi> Defendant, and a cross Cause wherein <hi>Robert Walley</hi> was Plaintiff against <hi>William Cutler</hi> senior, and <hi>William Cutler</hi> Junior son of the aforesaid <hi>Wiliam Cutler,</hi> were Defendants.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>WIlliam</hi> the Father being interested in the premisses for a term of about 30. years paying 10l. <hi>per annum</hi> Rents, did by Indenture dated 28. <hi>Feb.</hi> 1659. demise the same to <hi>Robert Wally</hi> for 18 years at 40 l. <hi>per annum,</hi> for the first 3 years and 50 l. <hi>per annum</hi> for the latter 15 and gave a Bond of 200l. penalty conditioned that if at the end of the 3 years the said <hi>Robert</hi> should make it appear he could not be a Gainer paying 50 l, <hi>per annum,</hi> then he should hold it at 40 l. <hi>per annum,</hi> during the whole Term.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Robert Wally</hi> entred, kept possession, and paid the Rents to <hi>William</hi> the Father untill.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William</hi> the Father by writing under his Hand,
<note place="margin">27 <hi>April.</hi> 1661.</note> Assignes all his Interest in the premises to <hi>William</hi> his Son, and soon after delivered the original Lease, by which he claimed the counterpart of <hi>Roberts</hi> Lease and other the writings concerning the premises unto him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William</hi> the Son thereupon demands the Rent, which <hi>Robert</hi> refused to pay, unless thereunto required by <hi>William</hi> the Father, whereupon,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William</hi> the Father writs a Note,
<note place="margin">28 <hi>Iuly</hi> 1661.</note> signs it, and sends it by his own man to the said <hi>Robert,</hi> acquainting him that he had assigned his interest to <hi>William</hi> his Son, and requiring him to attourn Tenant and pay his Rent to him: first paying the cheif Rent of 10 l. <hi>per annum</hi> to Mr. <hi>Badger,</hi> who was to receive the same, <hi>Robert</hi> accordingly turned Tennant, paid his Rent to <hi>William</hi> the Sun until,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William</hi> the Father and <hi>William</hi> the Son being at difference,
<note place="margin">29 <hi>Sept.</hi> 1662. <hi>Mic. Term</hi> 1662 <hi>Hillary</hi> 1662.</note>
               <hi>William</hi> the Father serds to forbid paying any more Rent to his Son, which order <hi>Robert</hi> observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whereupon,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William</hi> the Son sued the said <hi>Robert</hi> at Common Law for the Rent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William</hi> the Father exhibits a Bill in Chancery against <hi>Robert</hi> setting forth he had lost the Counter part of his Lease, that <hi>Robert</hi> refused to pay his Rent, and he could not sue him for want of the Counterpart, prayes he may discover whether he did not Seal such Counterpart and that he may be decreed to Seal a new one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Robert</hi> the same Term answers and setts forth all the matter aforesaid, confesseth the Rent in Arrears, and submits to pay it as the Court should direct, and exhibits a cross Bill against Father and Son to have them interplead to whom the Rent did belong.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William</hi> the Father answers,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mich. Term</hi> 1663.</note> therein confesseth the Note sent to <hi>Robert</hi> to atturn Tenant to his Son, confesseth the signing the Note, purporting the assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his Son, but saith he did it against his will at the importunity of his Wife, and her Mother, and intended it only for a present maintainance to him, whilest he should continue a dutiful Son: saith, his Son took all the Leases and Writings out of his Closer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William</hi> the Son answers,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mich. Term</hi> 1663.</note> setsforth the assignment, and the Note of direction to <hi>Robert Wally, in hec verba,</hi> and saith his Father delivered him all the Writings that concerned the premises, and the Counterpart of <hi>Wallyes</hi> Lease, and sets forth the reason of his Fathers anger, because he refused to be bound with him for a great sum of moneys, which he refused because he was bound with him for many great sums, and had no collateral security, whereupon his Father turned him out of Doors. From <hi>Hillary</hi> 1662. till a ter <hi>Trinity</hi> 1666. <hi>William</hi> the Father never proceeded in his cause, whereupon <hi>William</hi> the Son and his Wife and Children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ready to starve; <hi>Robert</hi> was advised by Council (he having the right) to surrender up his Lease to him and take a new one from him for the remainder of the 18 years, which he did do accordingly, and paid <hi>William</hi> the Son all the Rents in Arrears.</p>
            <p>After this in 1667.
<note place="margin">4 <hi>No.</hi> 1667.</note>
               <hi>William</hi> the Father proceeded in his Cause and brought the same to hearing, as also <hi>Roberts</hi> cross cause, when a decree was made against <hi>Robert</hi> to Seal a new Counterpart, to pay <hi>William</hi> the Father all the Rent, Arrear, since <hi>Mich.</hi> 1662. and the growing Rent, and decreed <hi>William</hi> the Son, to deliver up all the leases and Writings to the Father.</p>
            <p>Of which hearing <hi>Robert</hi> had no notice, he leaving the management to <hi>William</hi> the Son who finding himself agreived with the said decree, petitioned for a rehearing, and</p>
            <p>Arehearing was had,
<note place="margin">29. <hi>April.</hi> 20 <hi>Caroli</hi> 2.</note> when the decree against <hi>Wally</hi> was confirmed, but so much as concerned <hi>William</hi> the Son, his delivering up the Writings was set aside, all this time <hi>Robert</hi> had no notice nor knew of the hearing till the decree sigued and intolled, when,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Robert</hi> being served with the said decree performed not the same, whereupon he was taken upon an Attachment, and examined to Interrogatories, and their swore the truth of all the premises, as also that he had not that Lease made by <hi>William</hi> the Father, nor could come by the same, it being burnt upon the agreement made with <hi>William</hi> the Son in 1666. which was long before the Decree.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the Master of Chancery proceeded to state the Accompt of Rent in Arrears till <hi>March.</hi> 1668. Computed the sum to 113 <hi>l.</hi> The report confirmed, <hi>Robert</hi> served and paid the said 113 <hi>l.</hi> to <hi>William</hi> the Father; nevertheless is prosecuted to a Contempt, and to a Committment for not sealing a Counterpart of the Lease made by <hi>William,</hi> the Father, which is impossible for him to do; but he got the Counterpart of the Lease he hath from <hi>William</hi> the Son, ingross'd, carried to <hi>William</hi> the Fathers Attorney, left it with him, offered to seal it but it was refused to be accepted by <hi>William</hi> the Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Robert</hi> in pursuance of the Decree refusing to pay any more Rent to <hi>William,</hi> the Son.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mich.</hi> 1668.</note> the Son, brings an Ejectment against him wherefore he gave notice to <hi>William,</hi> the Father, to defend his Right, he neglected the same, and so <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> was Ejected, and <hi>William</hi> the Son had Possession delivered him by the Sheriffs of <hi>Middlesex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>William,</hi> the Father, since the Decree is become a Bankrupt, so that if he had any Right, the same belongs to the Commissioners of Bankrupts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Robert,</hi> being a Brewer, is forced to pay the growing Rents beforehand to <hi>William,</hi> the Son, otherwise must be ruined; by being kept from his water to Brew; Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertheless stands Committed for not paying the said Rent to <hi>William,</hi> the Father, whose Title cannot protect <hi>Robert</hi> in the Possession.</p>
            <p>And if he should pay to Father and Son, then must pay it again to the Commissioners of Bankrupts.</p>
            <p>But which is worst, if he pay to the Father and the Son, and to the Commissioners of Bankrupts: yet he is lyable to Committment as long as he lives, for sealing the Counterpart of the Lease made to him by <hi>William</hi> Father.</p>
            <p>Upon these Accompts <hi>Robert</hi> Appeals to the Supreme Court of Judicature, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament Assembled, praying the said Decree may be Reviewed and Reversed, he relieved, proceeding on the Decrees stayed.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the Lords Committees for Receiving and Considering Petitions did in <hi>March</hi> 1669. grant an Order for staying the said <hi>Robert</hi> his actuall Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon which Order, he hath ever since been kept out of the <hi>Fleet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is observable that in <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term 1669. <hi>William</hi> the Father, brought an Ejectment against <hi>William</hi> his Son, <hi>William</hi> his Son pleaded to him, the same Term Issue is joyned, and the Son been ever since pressing the Father to come to a Tryal, but he refuseth the same, and yet presecutes the said <hi>Robert</hi> upon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree aforesaid.</p>
            <p>Why <hi>William</hi> the Son joyned with <hi>Robert Wally</hi> in this Appeal there is no Derce made against him, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>1</label> therefore the Appeal irregular, and not by proper parties and so ought to be dismissed. <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Answer. </seg>
               </label> The Decree is against <hi>William</hi> the Son, in that he by his Covenants is lyable to make good all the damages which <hi>Robert</hi> sustains by the Decree: whereby he hath been forced to pay his Rent to the Father which he had beforehand paid to <hi>William</hi> the Son.</p>
            <p>If two persons in Chancery complain, and at the hearing the Court find, that onely one of them hath a right to Claim, the Court in that case Decrees for him who hath the Right, and not reject the Bill, because one is joyned therein who had no reason to pray Relief.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Robert</hi> hath <hi>William</hi> the Son Covenant for his quiet injoyment, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>2</label> and to save him harmless against <hi>William</hi> the Father; and <hi>William</hi> the Son having evicted him out of possession, he hath a remedy against him at Law, upon an Action of Covenant, and so may recover damages, therefore ought not to come into Parliament by way of Appeal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>VVilliam</hi> the Son it is true, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Answer. </seg>
               </label> hath Covenanted for <hi>Roberts</hi> quiet enjoyment, but it is onely so long as <hi>Robert</hi> payes his Rent, and performs his Covenants.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Robert</hi> being Decreed to pay to <hi>William</hi> the Father, did deny paying to <hi>VVilliam</hi> the Son; whereupon <hi>VVilliam</hi> the Son, hath Ejected him out of possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and yet there is no breach of Covenant in <hi>William</hi> the Son, the breach was on <hi>Roberts</hi> partin not paying his Rent, and so <hi>Robert</hi> cannot recover any damages at Law.</p>
            <p>There is a Bill of Review lyeth which ought to be brought before the Appeal. <label type="milestone">

               </label> there was such an Order, but they knew that Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> reported, that he did not find by <hi>VVaslye's</hi> Examination, that the same was lost: for he had delivered it up to be Cancelled, to <hi>William</hi> the Son; and therefore he had forborn to settle a new Lease; and they as well know that <hi>Robert</hi> hath divers times mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have such new Lease setled, and upon their own opposing, the Court hath denied to Grant it.</p>
